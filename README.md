# GradientDescent

Gradient Descent is a form of Mathematical optimization. The goal is to fine optimized parameters that minimize loss function.Think of those parametrs are trying to descend to the lowest point in a valley. The way we do this is by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to our parameter. This is used by Pytorch, Tf, scikit learn.
